abstract: |
    - The abstract must be an accurate reflection of what is in your report.

    - Your abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes,
        or references. It should be a microcosm of the full report.

    - Your abstract must be 150-250 words written as one paragraph, and should
        not contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material.

    - Ensure that your abstract reads well and is grammatically correct.

    - The abstract must cover; motivation, the problem statement, the approach,
        your results, and your conclusions.

# Introduction
- Topic: Introduction to the topic addressed in the project
- Motivation: Why would one care about the problem and the results? Cite
    appropriate references in this section. Explain the high-level, abstract
    problem that your project addresses. Explain what you are trying to achieve
    in a way that leads naturally into the next section.
- Problem statement: Describe the technical problem needed to be solved in your
    project. Note that most projects solve both a more abstract, high-level
    problem and a specific, technical problem: your problem statement is the
    detailed technical problem (your motivation should cover the more abstract
    high-level problem).
- Approach: summarise how you addressed solving the problem. Provide an
    overview of how you analysed the problem, how you designed a solution, and
    how you evaluated your solution. (e.g. use of models, simulation,
    prototypes, real-world experiments, cases- studies, etc.). What important
    variables did you control, ignore, or measure in your evaluation.
- Metrics: describe how are you going to evaluate your work.
- Project: list, and briefly describe your significant achievements in the
    project (probably 3-5 of these in a typical project). If you have come up
    with any contributions to the state-of-the-art, make sure to include them
    here.

# Technical Background
- The purpose of this chapter is to show your depth and breadth of reading and
    understanding of the problem domain 
- Include two sections:
    - Topic material (research material, if used, from published journals and
        conference proceedings; less academic publications, if required by the
        project, from other sources) – for example, what other work researchers
        have done already in this area, what results they have produced, what
        work has been done in related areas, what software already exists to
        solve this or similar problems, etc.
    -  Technical material (from any source: including books, websites) – for
        example, how to write a web server, how to use speci c Java features,
        how to use Ajax, how to use UML to validate your design, etc.
- Note that material relating to the motivation or non-technical background
    should NOT go here, but rather in the introduction

# The Problem
- The purpose of this chapter is to clearly explain the technical problem
    and/or identify the user requirements
- Provide any model(s) of the problem (e.g. equations, ERD’s, UML Use Cases
    & Scenarios, Activity Diagrams, etc.)
- Provide any analysis of the problem, leading to a greater understanding
- There should be no decisions made in this chapter

# The Solution
-   The purpose of this chapter is to clearly identify, discuss, and justify the
    decisions you make
-   Depending on your type of project, you may not need to include all of these
-   Anaytical Work: E.g. Equations, etc. that describe your solution
-   Architectural Level: E.g. Implementation Diagrams
-   High-Level Design: E.g. Packages, Class Diagrams, etc.
-   Low-Level Design: E.g. Method speci cations, Algorithms, etc.
-   Implementation: discuss anything interesting here, put full source code in
    an appendix or attachment

# Evaluation
-   Solution Verification
    -   E.g. use your equations to verify the correctness of your solution

-   Software Design Verification: how did you show that your design worked properly?
    -   Using a model of your solution Page 9 of 18
    -   E.g. use UML interaction diagrams to verify each scenario
    -   Software Verification: how did you demonstrate your software worked
        properly?


    - If you have not tested your software, then you cannot rely on
        your results. Clearly describe:
        1. Your test approach (i.e. unit testing, sub-system testing, system
            testing)
        2. Your tests (e.g. scenarios, test cases, test data, etc.)
        3. Your test results
        4. An interpretation of the results

-   Validation/Measurements: how did you measure how well your solution solved
    the problem
    -   Results
    -   Explanation of Results
    -   Analysis of Results
    -   Comparison with previous solutions (if relevant)


# Conclusions
-   Identify and discuss the implications of your work.
-   If you made a contribution to the state-of-the-art, clearly identify it
    here.
-   Discuss whether your results are general, potentially generalizable, or
    specific to a particular case.
-   Identify threats to the validity of your results (e.g. limitations, risks
    introduced by your approach, etc.)
-   Discuss your project approach
-   Discuss future work, based on what you have done (and not done)


# References
-   You must include a list of all cited works here. Use standard guidelines for
    these (e.g. IEEE guidelines3, APA guidelines) as advised by your supervisor.
-   The best references are peer-reviewed publications and books.
-   Note: you must NEVER give just a URL for a reference. At the least it must
    include an author (even if the company’s name), a publisher (may also be the
    company’s name), a title, and a date (if none available, use the date
    last accessed). If you have a URL for the document, include \[<URL>,
    accessed on: <date last accessed>\] in square brackets at the end of
    the reference.
-   Non-reviewed material (such as blogs, Wikipedia, etc.) does not make a
    suitable reference, except in the case of technical material have you have
    been able to verify by checking their implementation (you should state how
    you did this).

    -   Material from other publications (such as journals, newspapers,
        magazines, official reports, etc.) may be used sparingly, especially if
        important for motivating your work.


# Appendices
Include here all extra material, e.g. your source code, project management
(optional) including: the task list, Gantt Chart diagrams (or equivalent),
discussion of any significant deviations from plan, and how you managed them,
discussion of what you would do differently if you repeated the project.
